# Mash.TimekeeperHow well do you know your code is running in the wild? How long do operations take, on average?Using System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch to capture the duration of an operation works once, but what about repeated instances of that operation? Would you like to know how many times the operation occurred, how much time was spent on that operation, the average time spent per iteration, and how long the longest operation took?Timekeeper aims to solve this with a simple wrapper around Stopwatch which keeps track of your timer statistics.Your code will look like this:<pre><code>var timekeeper = Factory.GetTimekeeperInstance("operation name");timekeeper.Start();// the operation you want to measuretimekeeper.Stop()</code></pre>or<pre><code>timekeeper.Capture(() =>    {        // some code you want to measure    });</code></pre>or<pre><code>timekeeper.Capture(someMethodToCall);</code></pre>## Developer supportInvalid operations will throw exceptions, including starting the timer when it already running, and stopping the timer when it wasn't running.
